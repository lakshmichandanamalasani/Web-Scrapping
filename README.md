# Web-Scrapping

Web scraping is a technique used to extract data from websites. When using Python, pandas is often employed to manipulate and analyze the scraped data.

This project demonstrates the process of web scraping using Pythonâ€™s requests and BeautifulSoup libraries, combined with pandas for data manipulation and analysis. The result is a structured dataset that can be further analyzed or visualized.
